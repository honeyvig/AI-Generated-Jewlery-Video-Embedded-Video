# AI-Generated-Jewlery-Video-Embedded-Video
We want to create AI-Generated videos for our personalised jewelery business.

The videos should be short (5-10 seconds), created special for Instagram Reels.
Examples of videos from other jewelery brands:

Here you can find also a prompt for better understanding:
A hyper-realistic miniature scene where tiny construction workers are meticulously crafting a personalised heart necklace made in gold.
Without any life-sized human hands in the scene, the workers using miniature tools to put the crystals on the pendant and pickaxe for engraving the text on pendant. Some are polishing the gold metal, some are engraving and some are carefully setting the stones. The necklace rests on clear background with a precious light reflecting on it.

What we look for as final outcome:
1. Videos same quality as the competitors above.
2. In videos to have jeweleries that are in the personalised categori, as name necklaces, name braceletes, necklaces with birthday stones etc.
If needed I can provide you photos of some best seller from our brand.
Note: we do not need the jewelery to be exactly as ours, we want to use the videos just to attract traffic on our instagram.
Note 2: ideal if in the video can appear our brand name, as in one of the videos above: CHIC BIJOUX

Creating AI-generated videos for a personalized jewelry business involves combining several components, such as 3D rendering, AI-based visual effects, and realistic animations. For a short Instagram Reel-style video that showcases a hyper-realistic miniature scene, we will likely need to use tools that support 3D modeling, animation, and realistic rendering (like Blender or Cinema 4D), as well as AI-powered techniques for specific animations and visual enhancements.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown and a Python-based approach to automate parts of the process, using Blender (which is a powerful open-source 3D tool) and Python scripting for controlling 3D models and animations. This approach assumes you're familiar with Blender or willing to use it as a base for the animations.
Key Steps to Create the AI-Generated Jewelry Video

    Create the 3D Models of Jewelry: Since you're working with personalized jewelry (e.g., name necklaces, birthstone necklaces, bracelets), you'd need to create or source 3D models of these jewelry pieces. You can either:
        Model them yourself using Blender or other 3D software.
        Use existing 3D models from a 3D marketplace (ensure that you have the right to use them).

    Animate the Jewelry: Using Blender's animation features, you can create scenes where miniature construction workers interact with the jewelry, such as polishing, engraving, or setting stones.

    Lighting and Rendering: To make the video hyper-realistic, use PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials for jewelry surfaces (gold, silver, crystals, etc.) and set up realistic lighting.

    Adding Brand Name and Text: You can use Python scripting within Blender to programmatically add your brand name (e.g., "CHIC BIJOUX") in the video.

    Rendering the Video: Once the animation is done, you can render the scene to generate a short 5-10 second video clip.

    Post-Processing (optional): After rendering the video, you may want to add final touches like color grading, effects, or music in a video editing tool.

Python Script to Automate the Animation Process in Blender

First, install Blender and make sure it’s set up with Python scripting. The code below will give you a template to automate parts of the animation, especially creating the miniature workers and simulating the crafting process.

Here’s how you can use Python to control Blender for automating animations:

import bpy
import random

# Clear existing objects
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='SELECT')
bpy.ops.object.delete(use_global=False)

# Set up the scene
bpy.context.scene.render.resolution_x = 1920  # 1080p resolution for Instagram Reels
bpy.context.scene.render.resolution_y = 1080
bpy.context.scene.render.fps = 24  # Ideal for smooth animation

# Create jewelry object (this can be replaced with your own 3D model)
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=1, location=(0, 0, 0))  # Example for sphere (can be a necklace or other)
jewelry = bpy.context.object
jewelry.name = 'JewelryObject'
jewelry.scale = (1, 1, 0.2)  # Scale for a pendant shape (you can replace this with your own model)

# Material for the jewelry (gold)
material = bpy.data.materials.new("GoldMaterial")
material.use_nodes = True
bsdf = material.node_tree.nodes["Principled BSDF"]
bsdf.inputs['Base Color'].default_value = (1, 0.843, 0, 1)  # Gold color
bsdf.inputs['Roughness'].default_value = 0.3  # Slight roughness for realism
jewelry.data.materials.append(material)

# Add lighting
bpy.ops.object.light_add(type='POINT', location=(0, 0, 5))
light = bpy.context.object
light.data.energy = 1000  # Light intensity
light.data.size = 5  # Light softness

# Camera setup
bpy.ops.object.camera_add(location=(4, -8, 4))
camera = bpy.context.object
camera.rotation_euler = (1.109, 0, 0.8)  # Camera angles for close-up view of jewelry

# Set the camera to be the active camera
bpy.context.scene.camera = camera

# Add some simple workers (miniature workers can be represented by simple objects or custom models)
def create_worker(location):
    bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cone_add(vertices=4, radius1=0.1, radius2=0.1, depth=0.3, location=location)
    worker = bpy.context.object
    worker.name = 'Worker'
    return worker

# Place miniature workers around the jewelry (random positions for demonstration)
workers = []
for _ in range(3):
    location = (random.uniform(-1.5, 1.5), random.uniform(-1.5, 1.5), random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))
    workers.append(create_worker(location))

# Animate the workers (simple animation of movement)
def animate_worker(worker, start_frame, end_frame, start_location, end_location):
    worker.location = start_location
    worker.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=start_frame)
    worker.location = end_location
    worker.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=end_frame)

# Example: Animate workers moving towards the jewelry and interacting with it
for worker in workers:
    animate_worker(worker, 1, 250, worker.location, (0, 0, 0.3))  # Simple animation moving toward jewelry

# Add brand name "CHIC BIJOUX" (optional text)
bpy.ops.object.text_add(location=(0, 0, -2))
brand_name = bpy.context.object
brand_name.data.body = "CHIC BIJOUX"
brand_name.scale = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
brand_name.location = (0, 0, -2)

# Add material to the text (white or other suitable color)
text_material = bpy.data.materials.new("TextMaterial")
text_material.use_nodes = True
brand_name.data.materials.append(text_material)

# Set keyframes for the brand name's fade-in effect
brand_name.keyframe_insert(data_path="scale", frame=1)
brand_name.scale = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
brand_name.keyframe_insert(data_path="scale", frame=20)

# Render the animation
bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = "/tmp/jewelry_video.mp4"
bpy.ops.render.render(animation=True)

print("Animation complete!")

Explanation:

    Scene Setup: The script sets up a camera and lighting in Blender.
    Jewelry Model: A sphere is created to represent the jewelry. You would replace this with your own 3D jewelry model.
    Miniature Workers: The script creates miniature workers (represented as cones for simplicity). You can replace these with more detailed 3D models of workers.
    Animation: Simple animation is applied to the workers, making them move toward the jewelry.
    Brand Name: The brand name "CHIC BIJOUX" is added as text and animated to fade in.
    Rendering: The scene is rendered as a video in MP4 format.

Post-Processing and Export:

    After rendering, you can use video editing software (like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve) for further refinement, adding effects or background music.
    Make sure the video output fits Instagram Reels' requirements (short, 1080x1920 resolution, and 15 seconds or less).

Conclusion:

The code above provides a foundation for automating the creation of AI-generated jewelry videos. It uses Python and Blender for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering, and you can extend it with more realistic miniature workers, jewelry models, and camera movements. By adjusting lighting, textures, and animations, you can create hyper-realistic promotional content that aligns with your brand's needs.
